    <h1>Dreamer of Dreams.</h1>
    <p>Hello there. I'm Theodore. You may also know me as Adam, or Red. Whichever name it is you know me by, welcome. Here are some things that I've made over the course of my life and I'd like to share with you. Enjoy!</p>
    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>
      Here's all the music I've ever either written or co-written and has also been recorded.
      <a href="https://soundcloud.com/adamfc-music">Listen on Soundcloud</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Photography</h2>
    <p>I took tens of thousands of photogrpahs from ~2012 until ~2016. These were mostly photographs taken on the streets. You can see my favourites <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/someplacenice">on Flickr</a>.</p>
